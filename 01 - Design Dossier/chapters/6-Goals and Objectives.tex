\subsection{Technical Goal(s)}
Within 16 weeks, a feasibility study of highly specialized features/capabilities for a potentially new AUAV for a three-letter national agency is to be completed. The customer has also requested baseline documentation and associated deliverables. Finally, the client has provided funding for FIT to do a feasibility study for a Mobile Command Center (MCC) that can be placed in a remote, difficult-to-access location. Table below outlines various tasks that must be completed as well as the estimated time for completion depending on the project commencement date.
