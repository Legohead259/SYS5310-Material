\subsection{Quality Functional Deployment}
    The Stakeholder Requirements were evaluated for the project feasibility and any associated risks. The team developed a Quality Functional Deployment (QFD) to capture the critical aspects of the Stakeholder Requirements and to give a visual representation to the technical responses for these driving requirements. Additionally, we conducted benchmarking studies to determine the feasibility and quantitatively compared our solution to comparative products to ensure we met or exceeded every given requirement and the standards of our competitors.

    The team used a modified QFD. This provides a quantitative value to the requirements (functional and stakeholder). Each stakeholder requirement was given an importance value determined by how crucial it was to the projects needs and functions. The values are multiplied to give a functional requirement score which is then multiplied again by a degree of difficulty factor. The final score is the functional requirements importance and ranking.

    After inputting all the data and populating the QFD (Figure 1), the team has a good understanding of the most crucial parts of project. The two most important functional requirements, according to this QFD, are the off-board processing capabilities and the Spatial Resolution. These requirements dictate the detail that can be processed by the AUAV’s optical sensors and the speed at which the information can be processed. The system’s reliability and the use of standard equipment also hold quite a bit of importance as well. A more detailed version of the QFD can be found in the Supporting Documentation, here for readability.
