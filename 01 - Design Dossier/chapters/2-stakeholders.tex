\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
    An investigation of other stakeholders yielded individuals and groups that Futuristic Innovative Technologies (FIT) may need to consult with, have negative interest in the project succeeding, or may benefit from the success of the project. Table \ref{tab:other_stakeholders} summarizes the other stakeholders for this project.

    It is expected that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will need to be consulted to obtain airframe and airworthiness certifications and that the State and Municipal Governments of the US. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will be consulted to obtain transmitting licenses. As well, FIT will need to consult with COTS suppliers for system components. Depending on the requirements, FIT may need to contract with, or sub-contract work to, subject matter experts (SMEs) to resolve deficiencies during the project.  General Atomics as the designer of the UAV being modified will need to be consulted for drawings, cable routing and other issues that will impact the design. Applicable Embassies will also need to be contacted to ensure proper permissions and certifications for overseas deployment.
    
    Although we believe that all design work can be performed in-house, FIT should be aware that Northrop Grumman and any other bidders are negative stakeholders that FIT may need to contract out for specialized components to adhere to schedule, cost, quality, and risk expectations are met, although direct competitors in the AUAV sector. The other negative stakeholders and functional beneficiaries will not be actively engaged in the project otherwise.
    
    Especially considering the benign appearance of the AUAV and the advanced search and rescue functions, the product may be of interest to agencies and organizations that regularly participate in rescue efforts in extreme environments. The product may be beneficial to these stakeholders with minimal changes or updates.
